I'm in my 1st year of BSc Computer Science at the [University of Hertfordshire 🇬🇧](https://www.herts.ac.uk/). I'm super passionate about low-level & embedded systems, especially anything involving bare-metal programming in C.

Currently, I'm working on mastering the deceptively simple language C, as I also work on projects that interest me *(like writing my own USB device driver & startup code for the RP2040),* focusing on really bridging the mental gap between hardware and code.

## Selected Projects
### **RP2040 USB Device Driver** - bare-metal USB stack written in C *(currently WIP)*
- Minimal USB stack implemented directly on MCU's USB hardware
- Implements full enumeration without vendor libraries
- Designed to be reusable and versatile when a minimal USB stack is needed
### **Guitar Hero Clone Game** - collaborative project on the RP2040 *(currently WIP)*
- Team project to build a Guitar Hero clone game with PyGame (game-side) and bare-metal C (MCU-side)
- Acted as technical lead: wrote RP2040 boot2 & startup code and integrated my USB drivers with the inputs
- Goal: abstract the hardware so others can program the inputs with minimal effort

## Tech Stack
### Languages:
```
C (primary)  ████████████
Python       █████████░░░
HTML/CSS/JS  ██████░░░░░░
ARM ASM      █░░░░░░░░░░░
```
### Platforms:
- ARM Cortex-M
- Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
- Custom 8-bit architecture (academic pain)
### Environment:
- Linux
- Tmux & Vim
- Datasheets on a second monitor

## What I'd Like To Learn Soon (~1 year)
- **RTOS:** as it's a reliable way to add multitasking & real-time responsiveness
- **TinyML:** interested in how models work with severe hardware constraints while still remaining capable
- **Dealing with electrical noise:** to design circuits that operate as expected with real-world interference
